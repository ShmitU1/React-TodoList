### About project

My project is a simple todo list that was built on the reacta library.... after creating an element, the list saves it in the browser's memory, so that even if we leave or refresh our page, the elements will still be there... you can checked element as they are done and also delete them... the code itself has comments so that it will be easier to read

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned the basic concepts in the reacta library.... I learned about things like useState and useEffect and how to use them and how they work.... I learned how to break elements into their respective components and how to import them into other components, and in doing so I also learned the principle of passing values to individual components (props).... I learned what modules are in react and how they work.... I also learned the structure of folders and what each file is responsible for.... to build the project I used vite, which built for me the entire initial folder structure with the necessary files for the operation of the application

### Continued development

In the further part of my studies I will delve more deeply into the reacta library to learn new ways to extend my applications and I will introduce more technologies to my projects such as: typescript and tailwind
